    <h1>Boggle River</h1> 
    <p> The Boggle River has crystal clear water all year around. At peak day you can see a crisp reflection of yourself as you gaze into it. At night, however, you can see bioluminescent crawdads illuminating the night, making for an eerie, yet brilliant sight. With 10.2 miles of smooth waterways, it is a great destination for families and couples who wish to spend some time away from the troubles and noises of everyday life. </p>
