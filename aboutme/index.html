    <p>Hello everyone, it is a pleasure to here this semester. Let me introduce myself. I am married to my wonderful husband, Marco. We will be married for 4 years at the end of this month (September). We have no children, but we do have two cats, Smoky and Gizmo. I am the oldest of 6 kids - 3 younger sisters and 2 younger brothers. I adore the role of older sister. We also currently live in Bentonville, AR. I was not born here, but I was raised here.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my entire life. I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for the peace, knowledge, and direction the Gospel and the church have brought me in my life.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include reading (romance and fantasy mostly), roller skating with my husband, watching new tv shows and watching new movies. Thank you for taking the time to read my web page. I look forward to getting to know you all.</p>
