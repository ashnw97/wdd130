      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website will help make adoption easy for individuals looking to find a feline companion or two or three!
        I want my website to show pictures of the fuzzy candidates and give a little information about each one, give the viewers education and statistics surrounding cats, and make the adoption process as easy as possible so that nothing stands in the way of these beautiful creatures finding homes.

      <h2>
        <p>The homepage of my website will be designed to draw the eyes of viewers with pictures of cats, inform the viewers with facts about cats and ownership of cats, and help to convince any unsure viewers with both the images and information. People who visit my website will be people that want to adopt a cat. I want to include statistics and encouragement for anyone who might not be sure when they are visiting the website. There will be at least three images of cats/kittens to draw attention and empathy. It will have easy navigation to a page with listed offers and a page providing information to contact us for applications and questions or concerns. These are two pages that I think will best satisfy the needs and reasons for viewers’ purpose on the site. I also want to keep the number of pages to 3 for simplicity and ease of access. Each page will include as much information as needed for the viewer. They will come to my site for the ease, price, reliability, and customer service we provide. Viewers will know that when they come to my site, they will be making an informed, educated decision, and their decision will be one they won’t regret. The website will be well-spaced, designed, and crafted for easy viewing, navigation, reading, and finding the information needed without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>An important part of my website that I know viewers will want to know is the cost and offers. My second page will contain this information. It will provide an offer for one application and an offer for multiple applications to offer savings and better chances for homing the cats. A third option I want to include for viewers who might not be able to adopt or want to help in another way is a donation option. This will help include all viewers and provide a sense of help and relief if they are not in the position to take in a cat. The donations will go to food and supplies for taking care of the cats that do not yet have homes and also towards application fees for those who might need help covering the fee while trying to adopt. This page will also include limited-time offers that will help viewers save and make their decisions easier. The first offer will be a New-Year offer and will come back with different holidays and seasons. There will be visuals to draw attention to each of the offers. Each offer will be very clear and concise so that there is no confusion between offers.</p>

        <p>The third page that my website will include is a contact page. It will include contact by telephone with an available number, contact by email with an available address, and contact through social media with available usernames and names to find us through Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. This is where customers will come with questions about adoption and what it entails, contacting us about applications when they are ready, submitting donations, asking questions about our company, submitting technical errors, and asking for any guidance through the process. For consistency, the socials will all be the name of the company (@wrightfelineadoptionagency). This will make it easier for people to find us and remember us when they want to come back or refer others to us. All contact sources will have responses from live people for a more personal experience. Each form of contact will have an image next to it so that viewers know exactly where to contact and what method is being listed. I’m including this page so that any questions that are not answered on the other two pages can be found through direct contact with the company.</p>
